## Minutes

- We discussed how we create our minutes and publish approved minutes

  - Hendrik to add all TSC members to the organization
  - CLOWarden is used to manage permissions (https://clowarden.io/audit/?organization=LFDT-Hiero&page=1)
  - LFDT created LFDT-Hiero as a public organization
  - Discussed: Can we have the website be private until the time we need to make it public? There is a media embargo until the announcement.
  - Hendrik will check whether we can make the repo private or if we need to work on a side repo and copy files over when the embargo ends
- The team is building the website using the same repo that was used for the open source website development previously.
  Hendrik will make sure all members of the TSC have access and can see the progress.
  The website content will be moved over to the official location when the time is right
- Hendrik gave an update on GitHub Hacktoberfest participation for Hiero
- Richard will ask managers to set a goal for each repository for creation of “Good First Issues”.
- Discussion about filling the remaining TSC seats. Should we pre-select the remaining members, or wait until the announcement and then hold the election?
  - Consensus is that we wait until after the announcement to hold the elections for filling the remaining seats
  - Richard will prepare a proposal for voting procedure for filling the remaining seats on the TSC
- Hendrik was unanimously elected as the interim TSC Chair. The vote for official TSC Chair will happen after the TSC seats are filled
