## Meeting Summary
  
- **Minutes Review:** Several pull requests for past meeting minutes are still open. TSC members were asked to review them to ensure broader input and facilitate merging.

- **Election Update:**
  - Jessica (absent) is tracking votes.
  - End-user seat: >50% of votes cast.
  - Contributor seat: ~25% participation.
  - Issues with eligibility in Helios voting were discussed; Hendrik and Jessica will follow up on discrepancies.
  - Clarification given about how adopter eligibility translates into voting rights.

- **Maintainers File Policy:**
  - Discussion centered on whether `discord_id` should be a required field for maintainers alongside GitHub IDs.
  - Concerns raised regarding privacy, personal identity linking, and Linux Foundation guidance.
  - Proposed compromise: Discord ID is optional but incentivized (e.g., visibility in Discord channels).
  - Scope field and "global maintainer" designation were clarified.

- **HIP-1195 Vote:**
  - Motion made by Alex and seconded by Richard.
  - Unanimous approval recorded.

- **SDK Governance & HIP Process:**
  - Debate on whether SDK-related changes should require HIPs.
  - Keith Kowal advocated for consistent process: significant SDK changes should use HIPs to inform the community and maintain governance parity.
  - Hendrik emphasized that minor or non-breaking changes (e.g., new utility methods) shouldn't require formal HIPs.
  - Suggestions from Richard and Diane to anchor HIP requirements to the Technical Compatibility Kit (TCK) relevance or potential for breaking changes.
  - May Chan and Milan Wiercx emphasized the importance of communicating changes that impact application development.
  - Agreement to continue discussions via GitHub threads and revisit in future meetings.

- **Go SDK Proposal (Next Week):**
  - Georgi, Stoyan, and Brandon will propose a Golang SDK version of the relay.
  - Issue will be opened ahead of next week's meeting for review.

## Key Decisions

- **HIP-1195 Approved**
  - The proposal passed with unanimous consent.
  
- **Maintainers Policy Deferred**
  - No formal decision on Discord ID requirement; further consultation with the Linux Foundation recommended.

## Action Items

- Hendrik to:
  - Follow up with Jessica on voting eligibility and Helios sync.
  - Clarify Discord ID privacy concerns with the Linux Foundation.
  - Coordinate on updating the maintainers' file format and scope definitions.
- May to forward account details to Hendrik regarding adopter voting issues.
- Georgi/Team to submit Go SDK issue by next meeting.
- Hendrik and Keith to continue GitHub discussion to clarify when SDK changes need HIPs.
