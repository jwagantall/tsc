# Hiero Technical Steering Committee Meeting

**TL;DR:** The TSC approved past meeting minutes, reviewed major updates on project transitions from Hedera and non-Hedera sources, discussed the Jumbo Ethereum Transaction HIP proposal (HIP-1086), and reviewed governance processes, including elections and repository rules. Initial consensus was reached on key structural and procedural changes, including a new repo for SDK collaboration and transitioning publishing namespaces to "org.hiro."

## Meeting Summary

- **Meeting Summaries:** Past minutes updated and pushed by Brandon Davenport. TSC members asked to review and approve the PRs.
- **Transition Update:**
  - Hedera projects: JSON-RPC and HIP repos migrated; next up: solo and DID-related projects.
  - Non-Hedera: Three projects already moved. Discussion on how to track potential projects for transition.
- **Election Process:**
  - Adopters file now live; needed to vote for end-user seat on TSC.
  - Nominations open, with at least two candidates already submitted.
  - Voting scheduled for May 7–May 31.
- **HIP-1086 (Jumbo Ethereum Transactions):**
  - Presented by Nana. Proposal enables support for large Ethereum txns without needing file service.
  - Limits configurable for size and rate; will improve fairness and reduce operator costs.
  - TSC approved the direction of the HIP (first phase of new two-step HIP process).
- **Repository Rules:**
  - Jessica presented default branch protection rules (e.g., 1 approval required, title checks, etc.).
  - Flexibility granted to certain repos (e.g., minutes repo).
  - No formal vote required; consensus reached.
- **SDK Collaboration Hub:**
  - New repo to house shared SDK metadata and practices approved without objections.
- **Publishing Strategy:**
  - Roger presented proposal to shift namespace to `org.hiero` on Maven Central and `hiero-ledger` on npm.
  - Dual-publishing technically possible but complex; preferred to fully switch over with notice.

## Key Decisions
