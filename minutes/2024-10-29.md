### **Meeting Summary:**

#### **1. Approval of Previous Meeting Minutes**

- **Status:** Deferred
  - Due to the absence of a quorum at the beginning of the meeting, approval of the previous meeting minutes was deferred to the next meeting.
- **Action Item:**
  - **Brandon Davenport** will prepare pull requests for the meeting minutes from the previous and current meetings for approval at the next meeting.

---

#### **2. Discussion on Meeting Scheduling and Time Zone Differences**

- **Issue:**
  - Confusion arose due to daylight saving time changes not being synchronized across different regions, leading to conflicting meeting times on attendees' calendars.
- **Points Discussed:**
  - Duplicate calendar invites were causing confusion.
  - Some attendees were unsure about the correct meeting time.
  - The Hiero calendar subscription process may be contributing to the issue.
- **Decisions Made:**
  - **Hendrik Ebbers** deleted duplicate calendar invites to prevent future confusion.
- **Action Items:**
  - **Richard Bair** will coordinate with **Blanca** to ensure all TSC members have the correct calendar subscriptions.

---

#### **3. GitHub Roles and Permissions for Hiero Repositories**

- **Context:**
  - Need to define roles and permissions for GitHub repositories within Hiero to streamline project management.
- **Roles Discussed:**
  - **Admin:** Full permissions, including managing repository settings, branch protections, and team access.
    - Proposal: Admin rights to be assigned to TSC.
  - **Maintainer:** Ability to manage repository content without administrative privileges.
    - Maintainers would have the "maintain" role in GitHub.
  - **Committer:** Contributors with write access to repositories.
    - Committers would have the "write" role in GitHub.
  - **Community/Contributor:** General public with read access and ability to open issues and pull requests.
- **Key Points:**
  - Admin rights should not be limited to the Linux Foundation to avoid bottlenecks.
  - Maintainers need sufficient permissions to manage labels, merge pull requests, and handle branch protections.
  - A balance between permissions is necessary to ensure smooth operations without compromising security.
- **Action Items:**
  - **Hendrik Ebbers** will draft detailed documentation outlining the roles and permissions for review at the next meeting.
  - The documentation will include a matrix mapping GitHub roles to Hiero groups.

#### **4. Project Transfer to Hiero: Jake Hall's GoMint REST API**

- **Presentation by Jake Hall:**
  - Introduced the **GoMint REST API**, a Hedera REST API built in JavaScript using **NestJS** (TypeScript-based framework).
  - The API facilitates:
    - Account creation (including with aliases).
    - Token creation with metadata handling compliant with HIP-412.
    - Creation of deals (atomic swaps) involving HBAR transfers, fungible and non-fungible tokens.
  - Aimed at reducing overhead for developers by abstracting direct interaction with the Hedera network.
  - **Current Usage:**
    - **GoMusic** uses the API for their NFT marketplace.
    - Artists have accounts created via the API, simplifying onboarding.
- **Discussion Points:**
  - **Architecture Diagrams:**
    - **Richard Bair** and **Alex Popowycz** requested architecture diagrams to better understand the project's components and deployment scenarios.
  - **Sponsors:**
    - **Hendrik Ebbers** is sponsoring the project.
    - Confirmation needed on whether **Ed** is the second sponsor.
  - **Open Source Readiness:**
    - The repository has been made public recently.
    - Documentation and developer setup guides are available.
    - License compliance checks are underway using Snyk.
- **Action Items:**
  - **Jake Hall** will:
    - Create an issue on the Hiero TSC repository with detailed information about the project, including architecture diagrams.
    - Continue working on license compliance and dependency checks.
  - **Hendrik Ebbers** will assist Jake in navigating the project transfer process, including compliance checks and licensing.
  - **Diane Mueller** will coordinate with the Linux Foundation (**Rye** and **David Boswell**) to clarify the process for transferring projects to Hiero Labs.

#### **5. Discussion on Higher-Level APIs and SDK Enhancements**

- **Context:**
  - Interest in developing higher-level APIs over existing SDKs to simplify development for enterprise applications.
- **Points Discussed:**
  - **Hendrik Ebbers** has been working on similar higher-level services for the Java SDK.
  - Goal is to create injectable services (e.g., NFT service, account service) for easier interaction with the Hedera network.
  - Alignment with Jake Hall's work on the JavaScript side.
- **Action Items:**
  - **Hendrik Ebbers** will continue developing Java-based services with the intention of proposing them for inclusion in Hiero.
  - Collaboration between **Jake Hall** and **Hendrik Ebbers** to align efforts and share best practices.
