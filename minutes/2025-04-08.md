# Hiero Technical Steering Committee Meeting

**TL;DR:** Hiero’s TSC reviewed updates on project transitions and upcoming elections. A major topic was a proposal to bring the Hashgraph Online Standards SDK into the Hiero project. The TSC welcomed the idea but postponed a vote to allow time for additional governance and naming discussions.

## Meeting Summary

- **Approval of Previous Minutes**  
  Multiple pull requests are pending approval, including one from January. TSC members are encouraged to review and merge.

- **Project Transition Updates**  
  All Hedera-originated projects except for "Solo" have been successfully transferred. Solo’s transfer is targeted within the next 1–2 weeks, per Andrew Brandt.

- **Community Project Onboarding**  
  Several community projects have been onboarded, and more proposals are in queue. The TSC continues to review new project proposals weekly.

- **Election Process for New TSC Seats**  
  Two new seats will be elected in May:
  - **Contributor Seat**: For those who have contributed merged code.
  - **End User Seat**: For builders using Hiero tools, e.g., via the Adopters list.
  Nominations are open, and more participation is encouraged.

- **Promotional Clip Suggestion**  
  Richard Bair suggested clipping and sharing the election pitch on social platforms to raise awareness.

- **Project Proposal: Hashgraph Online Standards SDK**  
  Michael Kantor presented the SDK and proposed onboarding into Hiero.
  - SDK encapsulates open standards into an easy-to-use JavaScript library.
  - Built by a consortium of retail orgs (e.g., HashPack, Badge, HGraph).
  - Long-term goal: add multi-language support (e.g., Python, Java).
  - Current SDK and standards governance is handled via Hashgraph Online DAO using tokens and on-chain voting in the Marshall Islands.

- **Discussion: Governance and Integration**  
  - Richard, Hendrik, and others raised concerns about the separation of standards governance and project code maintenance if it enters Hiero.
  - Keith Kowal and others highlighted various points as to why HashGraph Online SDK would be a good addition to Hiero, offering additional perspectives.
  - Suggestion to clarify the role of application-layer standards and possibly rework or sunset the application HIP process.
  - Agreement that the SDK aligns with Hiro’s mission and could serve community needs, but integration needs governance clarity.
  - Concerns were raised around potential naming confusion (e.g., “standards SDK”) if brought under Hiero.

- **Next Steps**  
  - Vote on onboarding postponed due to lack of quorum and need for further discussion.
  - TSC to revisit SDK onboarding and naming decision in next week’s meeting.

Presenter: Michael Kantor
